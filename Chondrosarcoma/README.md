# Chondrosarcoma studies

The objective of this part of my M2 Bioinformatics project is about the identification of targets associated with immunoresistance in oncology.
The first part concern the definition of infiltrated immune cells tumors and poor immune cells infiltration tumor link to bad prognosis in chondrosarcoma samples (from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7264).
We also interested us on Cancer Testis Antigens (CTA) known as up-regulated in many cancers and could be a good specific target.
Then, we show the impact of immune cells and CTA on the individuals survival to confirm the cold and hot tumors and also the signature matrix used.
After that, we try to confirm this by analyze single cell data and see if CMH 1 and CTAs are expressed and where.


## Usage and requirements
The pre-processing part of this study has been run on a Virtual Machine from IFB Biosph√®re (8 CPUs, 32Go RAM) and after scripts has been run on local.
All packages used for this are in this yaml file.

```
conda env create -f envs/cta.yaml
```
