# Project chondrosarcoma

The objective of this M2 Bioinformatics project is about the identification of target associated with immunoresistance in oncology.
The first part concern the definition of infiltrated immune cells tumors and poor immune cells infiltration tumor link to bad prognosis in chondrosarcoma samples (from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7264).
We also interested us on Cancer Testis Antigens (CTA) known as up-regulated in many cancers and could be a good specific target.
Then, we show the impact of immune cells on the individuals survival to confirm the cold and hot tumors and also the signature matrix used. We also work on the impact of CTA on the prognosis.
After that, we try to confirm all of this by integrated data with cartilage data to compare and confirm the markers and the cold/hot tumors.
